- 👋 Hi, I’m @ankatrabantka and I´m located in Leipzig.
- 👀 I’m interested in history, Central and Eastern Europe, digitalization in the cultural sphere, pedagogical applications on the web and many offline things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about webdesign and how to make cultural data attractively available for everybody.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications with open data from cultural institutions; illustrators are very welcome!
